# Bugs - Admissions

## Known Bugs

* Sometimes the notifications popup does not render over certain elements (did not have the time to solve)
* While posting, only one Image can be uploaded. Database and front-end have been designed to work with multiple images. Posting just does not support it at the moment

## Admissions done

* Whenever an auction ends and a user wins said auction, the auction can no longer be meddled with. A notification is sent to the winning user, that when pressed redirects the user to their messaging page with pre-chosen Receiver and Subject (aka the seller and the auction name).
* As it stands, a user cannot modify his auctions (did not have time to implement)
